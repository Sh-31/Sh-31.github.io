      <description>A modern implementation implemented a Hierarchical Deep Temporal Model for Group Activity Recognition, based on the CVPR 2016 paper. Achieved 93% accuracy using a two-stage LSTM architecture to recognize multi-person activities. Conducted ablation studies to evaluate the contributions of various model components and compared performance against 8 baseline models.</description>

      <description>Implemented a Hierarchical Relational Network architecture for Group Activity Recognition and Retrieval, based on the ECCV 2018 paper. This implementation models inter-person relations and hierarchical temporal dynamics using Relational Layer (Graph Relational Layer). Ablation experiments were conducted to assess the impact of relation modeling, attention mechanisms (Graph Attention Operator), and hierarchical layers.</description>

      <description>ImgCap is an image captioning model designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images. It has two versions one based on a CNN-LSTM architecture, and the other an enhanced version that integrates a CNN-LSTM with an Attention mechanism. To further enhance the quality and coherence of generated captions, beam search is implemented during the inference stage.</description>
